This licence is a message... and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it!
Sending this licence was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful organization.
This repository is not a place of honour... no highly esteemed software is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.
What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.
The danger is in a particular folder... it increases towards a leaf... the source of danger is here... of a particular file and commit.
The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.
The danger is to the mind, and it can kill.
The form of the danger is an emanation of undocumented code.
The danger is unleashed only if you use this software. This repository is best shunned and left uninhabited.
